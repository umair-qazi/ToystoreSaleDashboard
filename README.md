# ToystoreSaleDashboard
Hey Everyone!
I'm excited to share with you a project that I've been working on recently. I have created a sales dashboard in Excel that provides a comprehensive overview of toy sales across different regions, countries, and products.

In order to create this dashboard, I went through the following data analysis process:
1. Cleaned the raw data by removing duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant columns.
2. Transformed the data by creating new columns and applying various functions to extract useful information.
3. Analyzed the data by creating Pivot Tables and Charts to understand the patterns and trends in the sales data.
4. Built the dashboard by incorporating slicers, dynamic charts, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the data.

The sales dashboard provides key insights such as:
The top 10 selling products and their corresponding sales figures.
The top 5 product line and their corresponding sales figures.
The regions and countries with the highest sales.
Monthly sales trends and their comparison with the previous year.
The top buyer.
Month with highest revenue.
Distribution of sales by deal size.
Total revenue generated by the sale of all products.

The dashboard will enable businesses to make data-driven decisions by providing a clear understanding of their sales performance. With these insights, businesses can optimize their sales strategies and identify areas for improvement to stay ahead of the competition.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my project.
